# Symmetry Energy and its Slope Parameter

BUQEYE's version of J. Lattimer's well-known `Sv--L plot`, Figure 2 of our
[arXiv:2004.07232](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07232), can be produced using the
Jupyter Notebook `Esym_L_correlation_plot.ipynb`. In addition to
a static `pdf` file, we support the export of an animated `gif`, which shows the
different empirical constraints incrementally. This is, in particular, useful
for scientific talks and teaching. The underlying data is located in `data`.
