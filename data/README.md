# Pre-processing the data

This directory contains the Jupyter notebook to pre-process the data in the
parent directory `raw_data`. The data is conveniently stored in
`all_matter_data.csv` for straightforward access using a Pandas dataframe. This
dataframe is generated in `create_matter_dataframe.ipynb`. To smooth the data,
as discussed in detail in our papers, we use `smooth_data.ipynb`.
